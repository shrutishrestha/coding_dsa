1. Two Sum
Easy
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice. You can return the answer in any order.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
Example 3:

Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]

Time: O(n)
Space: O(n)

Logic: If we have a list of numbers and a target, and need to return index of the two numbers that sum up to the target then
- we cannot sort the array as index would be jumbled
- so what we can do is create a hashmap with keys as the ith item as value as its index if the ith item is not already present in the hasmap
  - iterate over the loop
  - the item in which we are in the loop is our ith item, the jth item = target- (ith item)
  - if the jth item is a key in the hashmap then return its value which is the index
  - this only takes one scan of the array as we keep on adding items to hashmap, and in later items scans, we only check the hasmaps as all the earlier values are in the hasmap already

        for i in range(len(nums)):

            if diff_value in hashmap:
                return [i, hashmap[diff_value]]
            hashmap[nums[i]] = i
        return []
 ```

1. Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears more than once in the array, otherwise return false. Example [1,2,3,1]
- Points:
  - We can do this
    - 1st: Check one item with each and every item []
      - Time: It takes O(n^2) to compare each item with every other item.
      - Space: O(1) constant time
    - 2nd: Sort and then compare only the adjacent [1,1,2,3]
      - Time: O(nlogn)
      - Space: O(1)
    - 3rd: Create Hashset and check if item is present in the hasset or not. This is the most efficient for time for space is more compared to others
      - Time: O(n)
      - Space: O(n)
```
class Solution:
    def hasDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        hashset = set()
        for i in nums:
            if i in hashset:
                return True
            hashset.add(i)
        return False
```
